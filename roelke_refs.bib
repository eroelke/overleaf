abstract = {Space probes entering planetary atmospheres are used for in situ study of their physical structures. During the entry phase aerodynamic forces exerted on the probe depend on atmospheric density. As a consequence accelerations measured by on-board sensors can be used to derive probe trajectory as well as atmospheric density, pressure and temperature profiles. In this work acceleration data acquired by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI) have been used to reconstruct the probe trajectory and the Titan's atmospheric structure from ≈ 1545 km down to ≈ 155 km of altitude. An accurate six degree of freedom model of Huygens during the entry phase has been developed and a new reconstruction technique based on Kalman filtering is presented. This technique estimates simultaneously the probe trajectory, the attitude profile consistent with measured data and the atmospheric density, pressure and temperature. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Vortex shedding from spheres has been studied in the Reynolds number range 400 {\textless} Re {\textless} 5 × 106. At low Reynolds numbers, i.e. up to Re = 3 × 103, the values of the Strouhal number as a function of Reynolds number measured by M{\"{o}}ller (1938) have been confirmed using water flow. The lower critical Reynolds number, first reported by Cometta (1957), was found to be Re = 6 × 103. Here a discontinuity in the relationship between the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers is obvious. From Re = 6 × 103 to Re = 3 × 105 strong periodic fluctuations in the wake flow were observed. Beyond the upper critical Reynolds number (Re = 3.7 × 105) periodic vortex shedding could not be detected by the present measurement techniques. The hot-wire measurements indicate that the signals recorded simultaneously at different positions on the 75° circle (normal to the flow) show a phase shift. Thus it appears that the vortex separation point rotates around the sphere. An attempt is made to interpret this experimental evidence.},

The purpose of this work is to develop a systematic visualization scheme that could capture Mars EDL trades as a function of a limited number of variables, such that programmatic design decisions could be effectively made with insight of the design space. Using the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) as a basis, contour plots have been generated for key EDL figures of merit, such as maximum landed elevation and landed mass as a function of four input parameters: entry mass, entry velocity, entry flight path angle, and vehicle L/D. Additionally, sensitivity plots have been generated in an attempt to capture the effects of varying the fixed input parameters. This set of EDL visualization data has been compiled into a Mars EDL handbook to aid in pre-phase A design space exploration and decision making.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Bocanegra-Bahamon2015,
abstract = {The planet Uranus, one of the two ice giants in the Solar System, has only been visited once by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986. Ice giants represent a fundamental class of planets, and many known exoplanets fall within this category. Therefore, a dedicated mission to an ice giant is crucial to improve the understanding of the formation, evolution and current characteristics of such planets in order to extend the knowledge of both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems. In the study at hand, the rationale, selection, and conceptual design for a mission to investigate the Uranian system, as an archetype for ice giants, is presented. A structured analysis of science questions relating to the Uranian system is performed, categorized by the themes atmosphere, interior, moons and rings, and magnetosphere. In each theme, science questions are defined, with their relative importance in the theme quantified. Additionally, top-level weights for each theme are defined, with atmosphere and interior weighted the strongest, as they are more related to both exoplanetary systems and the Uranian system, than the other two themes (which are more specific for the planet itself). Several top level mission architecture aspects have been defined, from which the most promising concepts were generated using heuristic methods. A trade-off analysis of these concepts is presented, separately, for engineering aspects, such as cost, complexity, and risk, and for science aspects. The science score for each mission is generated from the capability of each mission concept to answer the science questions. The trade-off results in terms of relative science and engineering weight are presented, and competitive mission concepts are analyzed based on the preferred mission type. A mission design point for a typical flagship science mission is selected from the trade space. It consists of a Uranus orbiter with a dry mass of 2073 kg including 402 kg of payload and a Uranus entry probe, which is to perform measurements down 100 bar atmospheric pressure. The orbiter science phase will consist of a Uranus orbit phase of approximately 2 years in a highly elliptical orbit, during which 36 Uranus orbits are performed. Subsequently, a moon phase is performed, during which the periapsis will be raised in five steps, facilitating 9 flybys of each of Uranus' major moons. A preliminary vehicle design is presented, seeking the best compromise between the design drivers, which basically derive from the large distance between Uranus and the Earth (e.g.; high thermal load during Venus flyby, low thermal load during Uranus science phase, low data-rate during Uranus science phase, the need of radioisotope power source, etc). This paper is the result of a study carried out during the Alpbach Summer School 2012 "Exploration of the icy planets and their systems" and a one-week follow-up meeting in Graz, Austria. The results of this study show that a flagship ESA L-class mission - consisting of an orbiter with a single atmospheric entry probe and flybys of the main satellites - would be able to address the set of science questions which are identified in the study at hand as the most essential for the understanding of Uranus and its system. The spacecraft, as currently designed, could be launched with an Ariane 5, in 2026, arriving at Uranus in 2044, and operating until 2050. The development of a radioactive power source is the main requirement for feasibility for this mission.},

As the world watched, each of the six landing missions faced potentially mission ending hazards within each of the landing sites while simultaneously dealing with diminishing fuel reserves and a unique landing environment. Hazards in the form of rocks, craters and slopes all were perilously close to each of the successfully landed missions and brought to light the incredible challenge each mission faced. For each of the Apollo landings, mission designers restricted all landing locations to near side equatorial regions and to near ideal lighting conditions for the crew. Unlike the Apollo lander, a next generation lunar lander vehicle (LLV) will have the capability to land globally and in a variety of lighting conditions. This will greatly impact the overall design of the LLV and the role of the onboard crew.

The importance of modeling atmospheric flight uncertainties in the estimation of an accurate landing site is also demonstrated. With these atmospheric effects included, the center of the final pre-entry landed ellipse prediction differs from the postflight determined landing site by less than 0.5 km in downrange and 5.0 km in crossrange.},

abstract = {The United States has successfully landed five robotic systems on the surface of Mars. These systems all had landed mass below 0.6 metric tons (t), had landed footprints on the order of hundreds of km and landed at sites below -1 km MOLA elevation due the need to perform entry, descent and landing operations in an environment with sufficient atmospheric density. Current plans for human exploration of Mars call for the landing of 40-80 t surface elements at scientifically interesting locations within close proximity (10's of m) of pre-positioned robotic assets. This paper summarizes past successful entry, descent and landing systems and approaches being developed by the robotic Mars exploration program to increased landed performance (mass, accuracy and surface elevation). In addition, the entry, descent and landing sequence for a human exploration system will be reviewed, highlighting the technology and systems advances required},

abstract = {Within the scope of a flight research project involving dynamically scaled models, active flow control was investigated for a modified NACA 643-618 airfoil. At low-Reynolds-number conditions, the aerodynamic performance of the modifiedNACA643-618 airfoil is considerably reduced by flow separation. Computational-fluid- dynamics simulations of the natural (uncontrolled) and controlled flow were carried out and provide the basis for a detailed analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. The simulation results for the natural uncontrolled flow compare well with wind-tunnel measurements. Simulations and experiments show a large trailing-edge separation at lowanglesofattackandaleading-edge separationbubbleathighanglesofattack.Tocontrol the laminar separationand improve the overall performance of the airfoil at the low-Reynolds-number conditions, time-periodic blowing and suction through a spanwise slot is employed. A strong dependence of the effectiveness of the active flow control on the forcing parameters, such as forcing frequency and forcing slot location, is found. In addition, linear stability analysis is employed to identify the instability mechanisms that are responsible for the effectiveness of the flow-control approach.},

These algorithms are sufficiently mature to be flown. NPC algorithms are highly adaptive, especially in the face of extreme dispersion and off-nominal situations. The performance and reliability of entry guidance are critical to successfulmissions. This paper compares the performance of a recently developed NPC skip entry guidance algorithm with that of the Apollo skip entry guidance. Through extensive dispersion testing, it is clearly demonstrated that the Apollo skip entry guidance algorithm would be severely inadequate in meeting the landing precision requirement for missions with medium and long ranges under moderate dispersions. In the presence of large dispersions, a significant number of failures occur even for short-range missions. The NPC algorithm, on the other hand, is able to ensure high landing precision in all cases tested. I.},

abstract = {The 2001 Mars mission was to demonstrate precision landing and aerocapture which may be required for later sample returns and human missions with pre-deployed habitats and low acceleration constraints. A typical entry trajectory will perform a direct Mars atmospheric phase followed by a parachute deploy and then powered descent, while an aerocapture trajectory performs an atmospheric entry and then an exit phase targeting to apoapsis altitude and a specific plane. An analytic drag control algorithm, which does not require numeric integration, has been developed for atmospheric entry and aerocapture in order to minimize the footprint at chute deploy, and minimize the delta velocity required to get to a circular orbit in the right plane. Mission requirements and constraints are reviewed followed by a discussion of the development and application of analytic drag control and the similarities between entry and aerocapture. Results from a six degree of freedom simulation will also be presented. Preliminary findings show that footprint requirements can be met with an analytic approach, and delta velocities within limits for the aerocapture,},

@article{Lockwood2006_venus,
abstract = {Previous high level analysis has indicated that significant mass savings may be possible for planetary science missions if aerocapture is employed to place a spacecraft in orbit. In 2001 the In-Space Propulsion program identified aerocapture as one of the top three propulsion technologies for planetary exploration but that higher fidelity analysis was required to verify the favorable results and to determine if any supporting technology gaps exist that would enable or enhance aerocapture missions. A series of three studies has been conducted to assess, from an overall system point of view, the merit of using aerocapture at Titan, Neptune and Venus. These were chosen as representative of a moon with an atmosphere, an outer giant gas planet and an inner planet. The Venus mission, based on desirable science from plans for Solar System Exploration and Principal Investigator proposals, to place a spacecraft in a 300km polar orbit was examined and the details of the study are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {During the past five decades, entry guidance methods have gone through major evolutions, largely driven by the needs of different types of entry vehicles and greatly increased onboard computation capabilities. Numerical predictor-corrector algorithms have emerged in recent years to hold the potential to become the next prevalent entry guidance method. This paper aims at developing a method that is centered on a single baseline predictor-corrector algorithm and will be applicable to a wide range of vehicles with varying lifting capabilities for orbital as well as suborbital entry missions. Different needs for additional (vehicle- and mission-dependent) trajectory shaping and inequality constraint enforcement are met by appropriate augmentations of altitude-rate feedback to the baseline algorithm. In particular, the long-standing challenge of enforcing common inequality trajectory constraints (such as the heating rate and load factor) with a predictor-corrector algorithm is now satisfactorily overcome, for either lowlifting or high-lifting vehicles. The method is successfully applied to three very different vehicles, a capsule, a shuttleclass vehicle, and a high-lifting hypersonic gliding vehicle.

The definition of the nominal entry trajectory and the accurate determination of potential trajectory dispersions are necessary for the design of the Pathfinder entry, descent, and landing system. Monte Carlo numerical simulations have been developed to quantify the range of possible entry trajectories and attitude profiles. The entry trajectory requirements and constraints are discussed, and the design approach and uncertainties used in the Monte Carlo analysis are described. Three-degree-of-freedom and six-degree-of- freedom trajectory results are compared. The Monte Carlo analysis shows that the Mars Pathfinder parachute will be deployed within the required ranges of dynamic pressure, Mach number, and altitude, over a 3{\textless}r range of trajectories. The Pathfinder 3{\textless}r landing ellipse is shown to be roughly 50 X 300 km.},

The study team concluded that the current state of readiness is destination dependent, with aerocaptured missions feasible at Venus, Mars, and Titan with current technologies. The use of aerocapture for orbit insertion at the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune requires at least additional study to assess the expected performance of new guidance, navigation, and control algorithms and possible development of new hardware, such as a mid-lift-to-drag entry vehicle shape or new thermal protection system materials. A variety of near-term activities could contribute to risk reduction for missions proposing the use of aerocapture, but an end-to-end, system-level technology demonstration mission is not deemed necessary before the use of aerocapture for a NASA science mission.

@article{Stanley2006,
abstract = {The non-axisymmetric, non-dipolar magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are markedly different from the axially-dipolar dominated fields of the other planets in our Solar System with active dynamos. Stanley and Bloxham [Stanley, S., Bloxham, J., 2004. Nature 428, 151-153] used numerical modeling to demonstrate that Uranus' and Neptune's unusual fields could be the result of a different convective region geometry in these planets. They found that a numerical dynamo operating in a thin shell surrounding a stably-stratified fluid interior produces magnetic field morphologies similar to those of Uranus and Neptune. This geometry for the convective region was initially proposed by Hubbard et al. [Hubbard, W.B., Podolak, M., Stevenson, D.J., 1995. In: Cruickshank, D. (Ed.), Neptune and Triton. Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson, pp. 109-138] to explain both the magnetic field morphology as well as the low intrinsic heat flows from these planets. Here we examine the influence of varying the stable layer radius in numerical models and compare the results to thin shell models surrounding solid inner cores. We find that a limited range of stable-layer shell thicknesses exist in which Uranus/Neptune-like field morphologies result. This allows us to put constraints on the size of the convective layers in Uranus and Neptune. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As the nation sets its sight on returning humans to the Moon and going onward to Mars, landing high mass payloads (≥ 2 t) on the Mars surface becomes a critical technological need. Viking heritage technologies (e.g., 70° sphere-cone aeroshell, SLA-561V thermal protection system, and supersonic disk-gap-band parachutes) that have been the mainstay of the United States' robotic Mars exploration program do not provide sufficient capability to land such large payload masses. In this investigation, a parametric study of the Mars entry, descent, and landing design space has been conducted. Entry velocity, entry vehicle configuration, entry vehicle mass, and the approach to supersonic deceleration were varied. Particular focus is given to the entry vehicle shape and the supersonic deceleration technology trades. Slender bodied vehicles with a lift-to-drag ratio (L=D) of 0.68 are examined alongside blunt bodies with L=D = 0.30. Results demonstrated that while the increased L=D of a slender entry configuration allows for more favorable terminal descent staging conditions, the greater structural efficiencies of blunt body systems along with the reduced acreage required for the thermal protection system affords an inherently lighter vehicle. The supersonic deceleration technology trade focuses on inflatable aerodynamic decelerators (IAD) and supersonic retropropulsion, as supersonic parachute systems are shown to be excessively large for further consideration. While entry masses (the total mass at the top of the Mars atmosphere) between 20 and 100 t are considered, a maximum payload capability of 37.3 t results. Of particular note, as entry mass increases, the gain in payload mass diminishes. It is shown that blunt body vehicles provide sufficient vertical L=D to decelerate all entry masses considered through the Mars atmosphere with adequate staging conditions for the propulsive terminal descent. A payload mass fraction penalty of approximately 0.3 exists for the use of slender bodied vehicles. Another observation of this investigation is that the increased aerothermal and aerodynamic loads induced from a direct entry trajectory (velocity ∼6.75 km/s) reduce the payload mass fraction by approximately 15{\%} compared to entry from orbital velocity (∼4 km/s). It should be noted that while both IADs and supersonic retropropulsion were evaluated for each of the entry masses, configurations, and velocities, the IAD proved to be more mass-efficient in all instances. The sensitivity of these results to modeling assumptions was also examined. The payload mass of slender body vehicles was observed to be approximately four times more sensitive to modeling assumptions and uncertainty than blunt bodies.

Common periodic oscillations at 4{\&}{\#}8211;5, 6{\&}{\#}8211;7, and 9{\&}{\#}8211;11 day periods are observed in the neutral density at 400 km in the 2006 data set, with the 7 day period being the predominant oscillation. Spectral analysis reveals that similar periodicities are present in both the solar wind and the planetary magnetic index Kp but not in the EUV solar flux proxy F 10.7. We suggest that the periodic oscillations observed in thermosphere density are a direct response to recurrent geomagnetic activity and associated high-speed streams in the solar wind. The lack of response in F 10.7 at the 7 day period enables storm effects on the thermosphere density to be isolated from solar flux effects. The Kp index for these events correspond to moderate levels of geomagnetic activity, and the resultant perturbations in thermosphere density are ±20{\&}{\#}8211;30{\%} of background levels. Although these levels of perturbation are small compared to major magnetic storms, their much higher occurrence frequency and characteristic long recovery time may lead to a cumulative effect on the state of the thermosphere and ionosphere.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a parametric experimental investigation aimed at optimizing the body force produced by single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators used for aerodynamic flow control. A primary goal of the study is the improvement of actuator authority for flow control applications at higher Reynolds number than previously possible. The study examines the effects of dielectric material and thickness, applied voltage amplitude and frequency, voltage waveform, exposed electrode geometry, covered electrode width, and multiple actuator arrays. The metric used to evaluate the performance of the actuator in each case is the measured actuator-induced thrust which is proportional to the total body force. It is demonstrated that actuators constructed with thick dielectric material of low dielectric constant produce a body force that is an order of magnitude larger than that obtained by the Kapton-based actuators used in many previous plasma flow control studies. These actuators allow operation at much higher applied voltages without the formation of discrete streamers which lead to body force saturation.},

@article{Wendt1982,
abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a standard technique used in a number of nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system, estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [5]. A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true non-linear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF, in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. Our preliminary results were presented in [13]. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.},

One of the main reasons is that the lander suffers tough tests from the uncertainties, which include atmospheric density, lift over drag ratio, ballistic coefficient, and initial conditions. In this paper, the desensitized extended Kalman filter (DEKF) is introduced. State estimations from DEKF are obtained by minimizing a cost function that is composed of the trace of posterior covariance matrix and the weighted norm of the posterior state estimation error sensitivities (PSEES). By applying inertial measurement unit (IMU), Mars orbiters and Mars surface beacons (MSBs) integrated navigation simulations demonstrate that the introduced DEKF is far less sensitive to uncertain parameters than standard EKF during Mars entry. With the increase of uncertainties one by one, the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of the states are still convergent in case of DEKF as compared to standard EKF where they become larger. At last, the consistency test is carried on to further validate the proposed DEKF. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {There are a number of peculiar aspects to parafoil and payload systems that make it difficult to apply conventional system identification procedures used for aerospace systems. Parafoil and payload systems are unique because typically there is very little sensor information available, the sensors that are available are separated from the canopy by a complex network of flexible rigging, the systems are very sensitive to wind and turbulence, the systems exhibit a number of nonlinear behaviors, and the systems exhibit a high degree of variability from flight to flight. The current work describes a robust system identification procedure developed to address the specific difficulties posed by airdrop systems. By employing a two-phase approach that separately considers atmospheric winds estimation and aerodynamic coefficient estimation, a nonlinear, 6-degree-of-freedom dynamic simulation model is generated using only Global Positioning System data from the flight test. The key to this approach is the use of a simplified aerodynamic representation of the canopy, which requires identification of only the steady-state response to control input to completely define the dynamic model. The proposed procedure is demonstrated by creating a simulation model using Global Positioning System data from actual flight tests. To validate the procedure, the dynamic response of the simulation model is then compared to inertial measurement unit data that were not used in any way to develop the simulation model, with excellent results.},

These systems all had landed mass below 0.6 metric tons (t), had landed footprints on the order of hundreds of km and landed at sites below -1 km MOLA elevation due the need to perform entry, descent and landing operations in an environment with sufficient atmospheric density. Current plans for human exploration of Mars call for the landing of 40-80 t surface elements at scientifically interesting locations within close proximity (10's of m) of pre-positioned robotic assets. This paper summarizes past successful entry, descent and landing systems and approaches being developed by the robotic Mars exploration program to increased landed performance (mass, accuracy and surface elevation). In addition, the entry, descent and landing sequence for a human exploration system will be reviewed, highlighting the technology and systems advances required},

Aeromaneuvering OTV concepts use atmospheric lift and drag forces for maneuvering (orbit plane and $\Delta$V change) to substantially increase payload carrying capability over all-propulsive OTV capabilities. This paper includes a summary of the results of feasibility and concept definition studies and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of aeromaneuvering as compared with all-propulsive vehicles. Manned aeromaneuvering OTV concepts will be presented such as the Aeromaneurvering Orbit-to-Orbit.

The AMRS mission requires that an AMRS vehicle be placed in the mission orbit where it remains on-station attached to a manned space facility until required for emergency crew return. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) to establish the concept of the aeromaneuvering OTV for the purpose of performing manned and unmanned orbit transfer; (2) to present data regarding aeromaneuvering OTV configurations, performance, system tradeoffs and mission applications; and (3) to present data concerning major design parameters such as dynamic pressure, heating rates and guidance.},

abstract = {Accelerometer measurements made by Spirit and Opportunity during their entries through the martian atmosphere are reported. Vertical profiles of atmospheric density, pressure, and temperature with sub-km vertical resolution were obtained using these data between 10 and 100 km. Spirit's temperature profile is ??? 10 ?? K warmer than Opportunity's between 20 and 80 km. Unlike all other martian entry profiles, Spirit's temperature profile does not contain any large amplitude, long wavelength oscillations and is nearly isothermal below 30 km. Opportunity's temperature profile contains a strong inversion between 8 and 12 km. A moderate dust storm, which occurred on Mars shortly before these two atmospheric entries, may account for some of the differences between the two profiles. The poorly known angle of attack and unknown wind velocity may cause the temperature profiles to contain errors of tens of Kelvin at 10 km, but these errors would be an order of magnitude smaller above 30 km. On broad scales, the two profiles are consistent with Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) pressure/temperature profiles. Differences exist on smaller scales, particularly associated with the near-isothermal portion of Spirit's profile and the temperature inversion in Opportunity's profile. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The development and testing of the Orion crew capsule parachute system has provided a unique opportunity to study dense parachute packing techniques and limits, in order to establish a new baseline for future programs. The density of parachute packs has a significant influence on vibration loads, retention system stresses, and parachute mortar performance. Material compositions and pack densities of existing designs for space capsule recovery were compared, using the pack density of the Apollo main parachutes as the current baseline. The composition of parachutes has changed since Apollo, incorporating new materials such as Kevlar{\textregistered}, Vectran{\textregistered}, Teflon{\textregistered} and Spectra{\textregistered}. These materials have different specific densities than Nylon, so the densities of hybrid parachute packs cannot be directly compared to Nylon parachutes for determination of feasibility or volume allocation. Six parachute packs were evaluated in terms of weighted average solid density in order to achieve a non-dimensional comparison of packing density. Means of mitigating damage due to packing pressure and mortar firing were examined in light of the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) and Apollo experience. Parachute design improvements including incorporation of modern materials and manufacturing processes serves to make CPAS the new knowledge base on which future spacecraft parachute systems will be built.

@article{Lu2018,
abstract = {Numerical simulation is used to perform parametric analysis to assess the feasibility of aerocapture at Titan over arrival V ∞ of 0-16 km∕s, vehicle lift-to-drag ratio of 0-1, and vehicle ballistic coefficient of 90 and 800 kg∕m 2. Aerodynamic forces, peak heat rate, and total heat load are evaluated. It is shown that aerocapture at Titan requires a lifting vehicle with a minimum lift-to-drag ratio of 0.2 and an arrival V ∞ of 5 km∕s, an equivalent propulsive $\Delta$V of about 4 km∕s, which is higher than what is realistically possible. Results show that aerocapture requires different interplanetary trajectories from propulsive options, and aerocapture with a vehicle of lift-to-drag ratio of 0.3 enables an arrival V ∞ of 5 km∕s and higher. The peak heat rate is well within the capability of the state-of-the-art technologies of thermal protection system materials. In addition, the vehicle can achieve an inclination change up to 20 deg via an aerocapture maneuver.},

abstract = {Taking advantage of the aerodynamic force to capture the vehicle from hyperbolic orbit to planetary orbit is a preferable approach because of the lower fuel consumption. This paper aims to research the Mars aerocapture process using the ballistic coefficient as control variable, and the inflatable deceleration device is used to change the ballistic coefficient. Firstly, the corridor is described in detail considering the different ballistic coefficients. Besides, the optimal aerocapture trajectories are analyzed, which show that they have bang-bang control structures. Additionally, the optimal results are showed under the different control structures, and the corresponding performances are presented. Finally, the optimal constant control problem is analyzed through the statistical results with the different initial conditions, and the change rules of the peak heating rate and the ballistic coefficient are given.},

The mass cost of ballute aerocapture is compared with propulsive capture and with previous work in which tethers are used for aerocapture in solar system exploration. Although both ballute and tether technologies require further analysis in the areas of structures, materials, and guidance, both systems offer attractive advantages over aerocapture with aeroshells and over propulsive capture.

The aeroassisted orbital transfer is formulated as a three-phase optimal control problem consisting of an exoatmospheric deorbit phase, an atmospheric flight phase that may or may not include thrust, and a second exoatmospheric flight phase. The two different variations of the three-phase optimal control problem that arise from the trajectory design are solved using a high-accuracy adaptive Gaussian quadrature collocation method. The fuel consumption of both the aeroglide and aerothrust aeroassisted maneuvers are assessed as functions of the maximum allowable heating rate, the maximum allowable integrated heat load, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of the vehicle, and the initial mass of the vehicle. Finally, the key features of the optimal aeroglide and aerothrust maneuvers are identified.},

@article{Demcak2020_MAVEN,
abstract = {This paper describes the operational design and execution of the MAVEN aerobraking phase at Mars from a Navigation Team perspective. MAVEN was designed to perform atmospheric science in a $\sim$150x6200 km altitude elliptical orbit. After the primary science mission, it was decided that MAVEN should circularize its orbit, as much as feasible from a spacecraft and mission standpoint, to better support relay operations with the landers. As a result, MAVEN performed aerobraking in the first half of 2019 to reduce its orbit to $\sim$150x4500 km altitude. Although MAVEN did not decrease its altitude as low as previous aerobraking missions, it had several unique challenges. Science observations continued to be taken during aerobraking, requiring dramatically better Navigation accuracies than typical for such phases. Furthermore, continuous DSN coverage with 2-way Doppler data was not available. So, with 40% less Doppler data, Navigation had to meet prediction accuracies which were an order of magnitude smaller than in previous aerobraking operations. Spacecraft accelerometer data was included in Navigation analyses in order to meet these requirements.},

The proposed mission utilizes aerocapture to transfer from a GTO rideshare trajectory to a LEO. Single-event drag modulation is used as a simple means of achieving the control required during the maneuver. Numeric trajectory simulations and Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses are performed to show the robustness of the system to day-of-flight environments and uncertainties. Similar investigations are performed at Mars to show the relevance of the proposed mission concept to potential future applications. The spacecraft design consists of a 24.9 kg vehicle with an attached rigid drag skirt, and features commercially-available hardware to enable flight system construction at a university scale. Results indicate that the proposed design is capable of targeting the desired final orbit, surviving the aerothermodynamic and deceleration environments produced during aerocapture, and downlinking relevant data following the maneuver.},
